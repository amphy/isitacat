# Is It A Cat?
Is It A Cat is a side project by Heather Huynh

It was created using the Clarifai API, Flask, and Python.

The program takes in an image URL, checks the tags to see
if it is a cat, and then says whether it is a cat or not.

TODO: 
+ Validation for links (make sure they are images or
handle when they are not)
+ Front-end stuff
